<h2>Our laboratory page shows our facilities and equipment . Through this page we are able to show off our studentâ€™s expertise and experiences in our school.  
This laboratory activity aims to emulate how the human body digests food, through the use of materials and food found in our homes. This way of visual representation and hands-on activity, may help the students better understand the digestive system of the human body. Through the understanding of the digestive system of the human body, we are able to give our body the right sustenance it needs to properly function. Through this we are able to adjust our diets to properly fit our needs, and help us avoid related injuries/diseases that may occur due to false misconceptions, and lack of knowledge.

                    <h3>During the crushing stage, the bananas and crackers going to the ziplock bag simulate the flowing down of food from the esophagus into the stomach. The water on the other hand helps to put the food down your throat just like what the peristalsis does in your esophagus. The ziplock bag on the other hand represents the stomach. The crushing of food inside the ziplock bag simulates the mechanical digestion or the contractions of the stomach to break down foods. The addition of orange juice simulates the digestive juices and enzymes being added to digest the food inside the stomach. The biomolecules present on the ziplock bag are possibly the carbohydrates(banana) which are already in smaller/mushy pieces and proteins(soda crackers) which are being digested inside the stomach with pepsin(orange juices).</h3>

<h2>This experiment focuses on how the digestive system works. These processes were simulated with indoor materials from home, such as bananas as carbohydrates and orange juice as digestive juices. The activity started with the crushing of bananas and crackers following the addition of water and orange juice to mimic the digestion inside the stomach. Then we squeezed the stocking, releasing the liquid into a tray which represents the gallbladder while leaving the solidified contents inside which represents the excess waste. There was also a separate activity where we dipped different number folds of paper towel into water representing the absorption process. 

This simulation experiment showcasing the digestive system helped visualize the processes of our bodies. It made it easier to understand the different steps and the different organs involved.
